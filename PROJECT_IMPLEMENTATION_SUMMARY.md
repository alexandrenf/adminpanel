# IFMSA Brazil Admin Panel - Complete Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implementation work done on the IFMSA Brazil Admin Panel, specifically focusing on the General Assembly (AG) management system with registration modalities functionality.

## Initial Problem Statement

The user was working on an IFMSA Brazil admin panel system and asked where to find "modalidades" (registration modalities) in the admin view, indicating that this feature wasn't visible or implemented in the system.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Convex (real-time database and backend functions)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **UI Components**: Custom UI components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Convex queries and mutations with React hooks

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. Registration Modalities Management System

#### Backend Implementation (`convex/registrationModalities.ts`)
- **Complete CRUD operations** for modalities
- **Real-time statistics tracking** with accurate capacity calculations
- **Smart capacity management** excluding rejected/cancelled registrations
- **Status-based registration filtering** (pending, approved, rejected, cancelled)
- **Assembly-specific modality queries** with active/inactive states
- **Registration validation** before allowing new sign-ups

Key functions implemented:
- `getByAssembly` - Get all modalities for an assembly
- `getActiveByAssembly` - Get only active modalities
- `getModalityStats` - Real-time statistics with accurate capacity tracking
- `create`, `update`, `remove` - Full CRUD operations
- `canAcceptRegistration` - Validation for new registrations
- `getRegistrations` - Get all registrations for a specific modality

## Specific Problems Solved

### 1. Modality Capacity Calculation Issues
**Problem**: Pending/rejected registrations were incorrectly counted toward capacity limits.
**Solution**: Enhanced `getModalityStats` to exclude rejected and cancelled registrations from capacity calculations, providing accurate real-time availability.

### 2. Registration Toggle Not Working
**Problem**: Admin panel toggle had no effect on actual registration acceptance.
**Solution**: Added global registration validation in `createFromForm` that checks admin settings before allowing new registrations.

### 3. Missing Modality Information in Review
**Problem**: Administrators couldn't see modality details when reviewing registrations.
**Solution**: Created `ModalityDisplayInfo` component showing complete modality information in registration review dialogs.

### 4. Auto-Approval Not Implemented
**Problem**: Auto-approval setting existed but wasn't functional.
**Solution**: Implemented auto-approval logic in registration creation that automatically approves registrations when enabled in admin settings.

### 5. Incomplete Registration Journey
**Problem**: Users were immediately redirected to payment without seeing registration confirmation.
**Solution**: Created comprehensive success page showing complete registration overview before payment, improving user experience and providing confirmation.

### 6. Data Integrity Issues
**Problem**: Deleting assemblies left orphaned data in the system.
**Solution**: Implemented cascading deletes that remove all related modalities, registrations, and files when an assembly is deleted.
